I'm Josh Buchea. I'm a web & mobile software developer based in Portland, Oregon.

I've developed hybrid mobile applications for iOS & Android since 2011, and I've been developing for the web for over 17 years. I'm passionate about clean code and delivering great user experiences.

I do most of my work on my 13&quot; MacBook Pro. Although I own various mobile devices for development and testing, my go to mobile device is my iPhone. I prefer to code in a text editor; my editor of choice is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). I push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbuchea) and I live in the [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/).

I'm a big fan of podcasts. Some shows in my playlist right now are: [This Week In Tech](http://twit.tv/twit), [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/), [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar), [Design Details](http://www.designdetails.fm/), [ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/), [JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/), [React Native Radio](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/react-native-radio/id1058647602?mt=2), [Adventures in Angular](http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular), [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/), [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/), [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/), [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead), and [The Joe Rogan Experience](http://joerogan.net/podcasts/).
