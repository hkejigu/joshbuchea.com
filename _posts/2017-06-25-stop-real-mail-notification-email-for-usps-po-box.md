title: Stop Real Mail Notification Email for USPS PO Box
---

This past year my family and I moved from Newberg, Oregon to Bend, Oregon. When we moved we forwarded our mail to our new address and relinquished a USPS PO Box to the Newberg Post Office. Months after our move we noticed we were still receiving "Real Mail Notification" (an opt-in mail notification service) emails for the USPS PO Box we no longer had.

You'd think a service from the USPS would be simple to disable or unsubscribe from. Unfortunately that's far from the truth. No unsubscribe link in the notification emails, and no ability to manage the service from my account on the USPS website. After scouring the USPS website and paying a visit to my new local post office in Bend, I was still receiving mail notifications whenever the new owner of the PO Box received mail.

Eventually a google search and a little digging around the web and I found this little nugget in the comments section of a [blog post](https://blog.red7.com/real-mail-notification/):

> I had to wade through a number of customer service reps, but apparently, you email them at `realmailquestions@usps.gov` with ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù in the subject line and in the body, write a formal request for them to discontinue the notifications.
